# Spark Installer

Currently it downloads and moves the packages for windows with a fixed version of spark and hadoop, it is pending to make a dynamic mode for versions.

## Bugs
Does not create environment variables for windows

## features
The installation will be generated for different systems and we will be able to pass it arguments to dynamically decide where to install it, always maintaining a default configuration for the ease of users.

Environment variables will be added automatically for each system
